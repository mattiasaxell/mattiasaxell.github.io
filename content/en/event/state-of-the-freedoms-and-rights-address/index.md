The Digital Freedoms and Rights are constantly evolving, legally, technically and socially. However they are not always improving for the benefit of the individual nor the general public. One example is the current EU Commission’s proposal on [Chat Control](https://chatcontrol.se/) 2.0 which would introduce a complete and total scan and mass surveillance of all EU citizen private communications \- effectively the ending of end-to-end encrypted communications.

The case study will be Sweden as it currently holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. I will focus on areas of interest to citizens as well as free software and open source advocates such as GDPR, Schrems II, open data, [Freedom of Information](https://handlingar.se/) and Freedom of Speech, [e-identifcation](https://www.fritt-e-leg.se/) and building political opinion in these matters.
