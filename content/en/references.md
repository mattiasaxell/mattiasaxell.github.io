#### Introduction

At least these 7 people have written recommendations to me in the past and more are available. Contact information is available on request.

#### Rolf Källman, The Swedish National Archives

“*Mattias Axell has in 2016 been hired by Digisam as process manager for the creative event and hackathon Hack4Heritage, which was organized in collaboration with the Stockholm City Archives on 14-16 October 2016.*

*During the first half of 2016, Digisam hired Mattias as a consultant to do initial planning and develop the ideas for Hack4Heritage as a creative event and hack focusing on open cultural heritage data and other open cultural heritage resources.*

*Mattias was then hired as one of two process managers who, in close collaboration with the project manager, further developed the process and program for the entire event, including a previous workshop that brought together organizations that contributed data or other content to the event. Mattias' inventiveness and willingness to always aim high has been both useful and inspiring, and with his pleasant and positive manner as well as good cooperation, he went well into the team.*

*During the event, Mattias was always on site and enthusiastically led the process forward, both from the stage and “from the floor” where all teams were gathered. Mattias' competence to facilitate processes and motivate groups to work towards common goals was a strong contributing factor to Hack4Heritage being a very successful event.*

*We can warmly recommend Mattias for similar tasks and wish him good luck in the future.*”

#### Ellen Pettersson, Historical Hackathon

“*I can highly recommend Mattias Axell. Mattias has during History Hack been involved in giving feedback and with co-facilitation of History Hack. With his calm manner, Mattias is good at collaborating, he is a determined networker and has the ability to create structure, set limits and take a natural place in the group. Mattias is independent, driven and the kind of guy you want to have in your team. Mattias is passionate about his core issues but is also listening, respectful and flexible. Mattias has several abilities and is therefore good at sensing the situation to complement with the type of initiative and competence needed at the moment. Mattias has good leadership qualities and is a person who is involved in building society and inspires and motivates people around him.*”

Mattias is knowledgeable and stable and a helpful and pleasant person who we at Trelleborgs Museum are very happy to recommend.*”

#### Mattias Goldmann, Fores

“*To whom it may concern,*

*In November 2014, we hired Mattias Axell, who assisted us in developing our organization as part of his training with Kaospilot*.

*The specific assignment was to assist us in the process of developing measurable goals for the organization, which is not easy for a non-profit think tank*.

*In this work, Mattias has been a great help, and has contributed greatly to the fact that we have come further in a couple of weeks than we previously did in six years. His way of collecting and processing views and experiences from the group, his ability to capture the essence of what is happening in a workplace, and his way of leading our discussions, has been impressive. In addition to the actual assignment, Mattias has also contributed to the fact that several other organizational issues can now be handled in a better way than before, such as relations between different professions, and how we structure our meetings.*

*FORES was already a generally well-functioning workplace, and with Mattias' efforts in recent weeks, we have gained very valuable tools to improve further. We warmly, wholeheartedly and unreservedly recommend Mattias for similar tasks and are at your disposal for further information.*”
