The Sysslomansgaraget parking garage in Kungsholmen was created as part of the modernist urban planning of the 1960s, with the vision of solving the inner city's parking needs through a large-scale underground rock cavern. Today, the vision is to develop the garage to meet current and future demands for safety, functionality, and accessibility for customers in the surrounding area.
