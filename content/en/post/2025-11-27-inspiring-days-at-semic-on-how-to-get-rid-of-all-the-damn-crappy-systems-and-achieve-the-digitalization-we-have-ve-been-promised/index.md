I have just returned home from a couple of rewarding and educational days in Copenhagen. On November 25-26, 2025, I attended the SEMIC conference. It is Europe's leading event for semantic interoperability and digital public administration. As an employee of MetaSolutions AB, where we develop the open software and accessible platform EntryScape, it was the perfect arena to discuss how we can create more coherent and effective digital ecosystems together with participants from many European countries. The conference was organized by the European Commission in collaboration with Denmark, which currently holds the EU presidency.
 The theme “Interoperability for Impact” fit our agenda and interests like a glove. SEMIC 2025 attracted hundreds of experts, decision-makers, and innovators from across Europe—both on-site in the hybrid format and online. It was a mix of in-depth workshops, strategic panel discussions, and an exhibition area full of groundbreaking solutions.
 For us at MetaSolutions, it was very much about showing how EntryScape, our flexible platform built on Linked Data and open source, facilitates the publication and management of metadata, linked data, terminology management, custom data, and data portals. We were able to make valuable contacts with players working in the EU's priority data areas and AI integration, and it felt like we all shared a common vision: a digital public sector that really makes a difference for citizens and businesses.

#### Some highlights from the conference

The conference kicked off on November 25 with presentations, where I and colleagues from MetaSolutions participated in sessions on data spaces, the role of AI in semantics, and digitally mature policies. A favorite was the discussion on how semantic standards can accelerate the EU's Digital Decade goals for 2030—it reminded us why we are investing in open source solutions like EntryScape to lower the barriers to interoperability.

On day two, November 26, the level was raised with high-level discussions on the impact of semantics on inclusion and competitiveness. The exhibition was a highlight, with demos of tools that integrate semantics and linked data – a perfect match for our own solutions. The biggest highlight for me was the presentation from the Swedish Agency for Digital Government (Digg) on their work with Interoperable Specifications (INSPEC), which my colleagues have supported.

#### Digg's presentation on INSPEC – a step towards future standards

I'm zooming in on this because the presentation touched on a recurring problem in the public sector in the EU. Digg, which is central to Sweden's digital infrastructure (think of the Ena platform for e-identification and data exchange), held a session highlighting INSPEC – an open framework for interoperable specifications that ensures public services work seamlessly across borders. The presenter from Digg took the audience through a presentation on how INSPEC is based on the EU's Interoperable Europe Act and addresses challenges such as data quality and standardization in a connected world where it needs to be easier to act, collaborate, and interact. INSPEC lays the foundation for how it will be easier to be human in a complex digital society.

#### What stood out were the concrete examples

This was about how INSPEC can be integrated with existing systems to avoid data silos and instead create a unified platform for basic data such as population registration and property information. This resonates strongly with our work at EntryScape, where we use SKOS for terminology and DCAT-AP for cataloging—precisely the building blocks that INSPEC needs to scale. The presentation ended with questions and answers that sparked discussion about implementation in practice. I hope this can be a breakthrough for Swedish, Nordic, and European collaboration. Digg's contribution clearly showed how semantics is not just theory, but a toolbox for real impact. Thank you, Digg, for raising your sights toward a more interconnected Europe and EU!

#### Everyone was talking about digital sovereignty and interoperability

Without demands for sovereignty and interoperability, we will never get the digitalization we have paid for. Several speakers stated what many researchers, suppliers, and people think every day: the public sector in the EU must start setting strict, binding requirements for both digital sovereignty and real interoperability—otherwise, we will never get the smooth, efficient digitization that Swedish taxpayers have been promised for almost thirty years.

It was as if someone had opened the window in a stuffy meeting room and read aloud from Jonas Söderström's book “Jävla skitsystem!” (Damn crappy system!) – but with INSPEC as the solution. Because we have seen it before: billions invested in rigid, locked systems that do not communicate with each other, where citizens are forced to act as couriers between the authorities' data silos. The speaker pointed to exactly the same frustration that Söderström describes: systems that are built to protect the supplier's business – not to solve the problems of the user and the customer. The difference now is that INSPEC and the Interoperable Europe Act give the customer the tools to break the vicious circle – if we only dare to set the requirements. Otherwise, we will continue to pay dearly for new crappy systems – hopefully with 2025 technology.

#### The next step for interoperability
SEMIC 2025 was a reminder that we in Sweden, through companies such as MetaSolutions and players such as Digg, are in a unique position to lead this development. EntryScape continues to be MetaSolutions' service to society – an open platform that is modular, accessible, and makes it easy to build data portals and share data, information, and knowledge securely. If you missed the event, check out the material on the Interoperable Europe Portal – there is plenty of inspiration there.
