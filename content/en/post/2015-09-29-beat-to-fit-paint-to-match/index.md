<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

- Participated in Carol Sandfords workshop and lecture on being Discerning.
- Watched a bit of a movie for the first time in a long while.

<blockquote>Happiness can be defined, in part at least, as the fruit of the desire and ability to sacrifice what we want now for what we want eventually. - Steven R. Covey</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Tools have I Used?</h2>

- Listening
- Theory U
- Discernment

<blockquote>"We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time." - T. S. Eliot</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">How do I Feel about the Project Today?</h2>

- The project feels rejuvenated once again by a fantastic day of multiple inputs.
- I also lost a bit of engagement in doing anything else than just relaxing. So that's what I did because that was what my mind needed.

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- That there is hope a regenerative future, starting with frameworks that create a regenerative life! 

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

- New aspects to integrate into my project which are absolutely invaluable!

<h2 class="section-heading">What are the Next Action Steps?</h2>

- Fixing my situation with the computers, it is becoming uncomfortable to see that my engagement is slowed because of that. I really don't like buying new electronics because there are often such wasteful processes of resources use.
