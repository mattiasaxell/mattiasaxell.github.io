<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

- Narrowed down the school of thoughts, approaches and tools that I will use during the research of my project.
- Had a chat about the potential collaboration with a co-creational event in Sweden next year as part of my project.
- Started Mehul Sangham's series of exercises for Heuristic Inquiry through "Disclosing that you are a Discloser" and the exercise "the Existential Path".
- Made a short call about the Freedom of Information platform and the preparation for the launch of it!
- Re-watched the first episode "Fuck You Buddy" from the series The Trap (2007).

<h2 class="section-heading">How do I Feel about the Project Today?</h2>

- I feel very good about it and that I am still heading in a good direction. I am getting a clearer insight into what I will be using as tools and not.

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- That there is so many things I want to use for my research but that that it is so hard to narrow things down.
