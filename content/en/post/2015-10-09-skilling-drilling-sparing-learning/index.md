<h2 class="section-heading">How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today?</h2>

- I feel good today however I am troubled by how to design the learning design. I feel it can easily be a task where I try to complicate things and lock myself down.

- It feels like the project can have progressed quite a lot in just a day through some calls although these are not ensured steps forward but very promising opportunities.

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- How much time I spent on not doing anything productive about the learning design, but when I actually took some time it started making sense. It also surprised me how great the connections were in my calls.

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

- I believe that my feelings regarding Learning Design has changed, the way I see it has to be done. I believe it can be quite an enjoyable puzzle to put down after fall vacation.
