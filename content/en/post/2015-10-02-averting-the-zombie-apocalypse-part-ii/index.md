<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

- Attended the second day of lecture and workshop with Zaid Hassan.
- Started using the frameworks for how to turn my exam project into multiple projects.
- Went to the Love Symposium that was hosted for the third year at the Kaospilot education. It was an enjoyable evening experience all the love that was expressed among participants through speeches and performances!

<h2 class="section-heading">What Tools have I Used?</h2>

- Complex Challenge Design Research
- Stakeholder Mapping - figuring out which organizations and stakeholders that could be in my exam project if it would develop into a social lab.
- The Iceberg Model from Theory U - using it to see similarities to the Social Labs way of working.

<h2 class="section-heading">How do I Feel today? And how do I Feel about the Project Today?</h2>

- I feel great with the talk I had yesterday.
- I feel a little bit overwhelmed by the fact that the majority of organizations in the world create 5-year strategies and plans just like Josef Stalin in the USSR. We all know what happened to the U.S.S.R. So why are the majority using that way of strategizing? Habits. Mechanistic and not regenerative habits as I imagine Carol Sandford could have said it!
- I feel thrilled about the idea of what it could mean if my exam project develops into a social lab and serves a bigger purpose solving complex challenges.

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- This whole idea that
- The A-world and B-world thinking. A-world is very good at what it is good at doing but has an "abysmally bad track record" when it comes to dealing with complex challenges such as poverty, human rights, sustainability etc. B-world is great at doing that but is so new that it is not as widespread in use.

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

- My thoughts on how my third year project could benefit from adopting the Social Labs framework as a reference to the concept. That could be more concrete when communicating with stakeholders etc.
