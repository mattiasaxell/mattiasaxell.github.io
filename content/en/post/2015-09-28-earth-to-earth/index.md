<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

- Woke up in the shelter of the forrest that I went to sleep in. Great experience.
- Listened 
- Called a potential project stakeholder.
- Watched "The House that I Live in."

<blockquote>Charles Darwin was known to always have a note pad on him, where he would write down observations that contradicted his theory, because he knew exactly what our mind is doing. When we notice something that doesn't fit our theory, it's in contradiction with that. Our mind is over time getting rid of everything that's not confirming what we expect to see. But he knew that disconfirming data is actually the source of innovation. - Otto E. Scharmer</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Tools have I Used?</h2>

- Discernment
- Generative listening
- Reflection

<blockquote>Become learning people, rather than teachers. It's all about learning. - Ed Schein</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">How do I Feel about the Project Today?</h2>

- I feel extremely good about it. There is a lot happening and a lot to do. 
- I still feel like I need to start reading everything that I wish to read. And there is so much archiving and data journaling to be done.

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- How I could see a shooting star for the second time in a short while. Beautiful!
- That most of our methods and system designs in society are not more evolved than being based on mechanistic or behavioural paradigms.

<blockquote>“I don't define things, I create a territory in which we explore” - Carol Sandford</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

- My level of discernment with the choice of tools and consciousness in choosing tools and methodologies.
- The view on destruction after watching the fantastic movie "The House that I Live in". The Chain of Destruction is explained to generally happen in this process: 
1. Identification 
2. Austricism
3. Confiscation
4. Concentration
5. Annihilation

<h2 class="section-heading">What are the Next Action Steps?</h2>

- Read the scientific paper "Forth and Fifth Levels of Systems Thinking" provided by Carol Sandford.
- Finish
- Really take the time to go through the to-dos, now I managed to list some at least.

<blockquote>“If you want to take a problem to make it a huge problem then ask the wrong questions and then feed us with the wrong answer.
