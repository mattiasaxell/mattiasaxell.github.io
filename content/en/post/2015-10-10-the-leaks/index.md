- Factual Listening.
- Empathic Listening.
- Appreciative Inquiry.

<h2 class="section-heading">How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today?</h2>

- I feel confused. Because when something very important happens it can be really difficult to be in that liminal process.

- The project feels good but I feel that I need to put the project on hold for a while because of what has happened. Thus the vacation this fall has just had the right timing. It is a little bit of a funny situation.

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- How fast the immeasurable can disappear and leave this world. Even thoguh it is very expected.

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

- My thoughts on where I normally put my attention. I get reminded to see poeple differently with more attention and appreciation.

<h2 class="section-heading">What are the Next Action Steps?</h2>

- Taking time to relax and contemplate what has happened.
- Process what has happened and be ready to do what I have planned for the week. It is also good for me In order to get out of my own thoughts and into something else.
