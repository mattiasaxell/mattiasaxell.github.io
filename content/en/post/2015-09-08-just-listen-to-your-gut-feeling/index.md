<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

<p>Went to the library and worked on the application.</p>

<p>I worked in the staff office. Pretending to be someone I was not. But it was a good and relaxing atmosphere.</p>

<p>Later went back to school to work on the application.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

<p>I got effective working on the application however it feels difficult doing it when having done it so intensely for a couple of days. </p>

<p>Also how difficult it is working on a text document without having visualised it on paper before to simplify thoughts.</p>

<p>That I really want to push people in a direction without saying why. I kind of wish to see what I mean with straight communication of asking them to do something and get my point. However I realise that I come out to them as seemingly trying to delegate and push a task upon them in a way that seem uncomfortable, maybe even could be passive aggressive if I would choose my words less carefully.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

<p>My approach on how to ask for help and have my needs met. E.g. today it mattered to me how a group I am in would organise to have a meetup. Instead of having long and gruesome conversations over chat and e-mail I suggested doing it over a poll survey. After pushing that on repeatedly I got asked why I did not do it myself, as if the person did not get the message - and that is when I realised that I need to be asking the right question. I also need to be open about why I would not do it myself and be open with the fact that I have full hands with the application.</p>

<p>The method on how to finish the application. Tomorrow I am getting the first feedback but I am also intending to finish with style by visualising everything in order to easier get it down in typed letters.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What are the Next Action Steps?</h2>

<p>Now I have kind of gathered a couple of them from the last days. They are all queued for Friday and the weekend to be figured out.</p>

<p>Reading is something I want to get back to tomorrow! I hope time will allow me to do that on Friday when the application is done.</p>
