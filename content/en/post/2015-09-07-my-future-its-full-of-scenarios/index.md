<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

<p>Re-Designed some of this website, learning more about HTML, CSS, Git and Jekyll.</p>

<p>Had guidance with a member of staff. Very interesting talk.</p>

<p>Met up with a team mate I had not taken the opportunity to hang out with one-on-one during the previous two years which is absolutely crazy! Had a wonderful time with very valuable talks and exchange of thoughts! </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

<p>How simple I have thought of combining the different concepts I might work with within a bigger concept for my third year. Thanks to guidance I realise I need to be more concrete visually and vocally with how I imagine different scenarios of how my third year might look.</p>

<p>The way that one can surprise oneself is truly fascinating. I find it extremely interesting how one can talk about doing something, knowing about how good it would be to do it. When actually doing it is so easy to realise how valuable it would have been to try it just a little bit earlier. And there are probably a lot of things one could say that for...</p>

<p>The suprises, depth and commonalities there in people that have been walking around for soon more than two years, and I still have not done much to explore it. That fascinates me. Connects very much with thought above.</p>

<blockquote>Some dream to escape reality. Some dream to change reality forever. - Soichiro Honda</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

<p>The strategy on how to figure out of what to work with for this upcoming third year. The journey self-discovery still has to take place in a structured way but additionally it will help to figure out the scenarios to make sense and choose what to work with.</p>

<p>My thoughts on how I engage with people in my team and in groups of communities and friends I am. It is easy to get stuck in assumptions and self-created realities that only exists with in my part of the multiverse.</p>

- Definitely continue the application and get feedback on it. Did not get to it today, totally got off track, yet another example of how technology can colonize my conscious (what I just had a revalation about yesterday)...

- Turn off all external disturbances when working on something important.

- Eat,
- Sleep,
- Act,
- Socialize,
- Repeat!
