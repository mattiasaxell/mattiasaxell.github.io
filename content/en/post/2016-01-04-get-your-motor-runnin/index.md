<h2 class="section-heading">How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today?</h2>

- I feel great to be back on track. The project feels like I have a burning excitement to launch in alpha or beta phase. Which I can do soon. And I have an idea of how to do it.

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- I think the amount of time it takes to get back in to a working phase. Also studying with a friend made me continue working until 22.00, but there was lots of personal things I took care of as well.    

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

- In a way I believe that my energy in the project has taken another shape. I'm curious to explore it. I also realise I feel I need to make my learnings more concrete and visual so I will figure out how to do that.

<h2 class="section-heading">What are the Next Action Steps?</h2>

- Plan the spring for third phase of project.
- Collect and organise all public bodies in one .CSV file and make specific adaptation for the import to the project platform
- Decide whether to do the webinar in February or not.
- Revise translation for Voice Over recordings for project movie on Wednesday the 8th.
