<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- That whatever the level of readiness you have, there will always be something reminding you of the existence of Murphy's Law.

<blockquote>Murphy's law doesn't mean that something bad will happen. It means that whatever *can* happen, will happen. And that sounded just fine to us. - Cooper, Interstellar (2014)</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">How do I Feel about the Project Today?</h2>

- I feel that I did not live up to my ambition with the look, quality and feel of this research design. But at the same time, it's also something that I feel should be in "constant beta" that I iterate on.

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

- The thoughts on how I do the daily journal. I want to make it once every day, but not necessarily at night. I can always update it the day after when I find time. Maybe do it in the morning. It's great to prototype the time.
