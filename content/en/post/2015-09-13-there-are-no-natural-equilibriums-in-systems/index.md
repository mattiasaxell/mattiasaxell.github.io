<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

- Watched a video on the idea of an open source future
- Finished reading the book "On Trust: In Business, Politics and Life"
- Watched the second episode of "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace: The Use and Abuse of Vegetational Concepts" by Adam Curtis. It really gave some great perspective on systems thinking and cybernetics and its background and birth through the theories of ecology and ecosystems.

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

<p>That it was such a great experience to get going on Github with a friend and help out to launch a Pretotype website of an idea he is working on. Truly inspiring!</p>

<p>What I think I will get a lot of time for does not happen that easily. I finished a book today but still there was a lot of reading to be done for the days with Andrew J. Taggart.</p>

<p>The coining and creation of the idea of ecosystems derives from a mechanistic worldview. As if humans created machines and that nature was a machine just like our systems. However it is understandable that Arthur Tensley was a man of his time and believed that could be the case.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

<p>I am now heading full on into research scoping, scanning and design of research plan, and I need something of a weekly overview to look back at what has happened.</p>

<p>My engagement with launching projects on the go has maybe become bigger than in a long while, it's really fun but takes time that I maybe should redistribute!</p>

<p>The view on ecosystems, as it was portrayed in "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace: The Use and Abuse of Vegetational Concepts". Systems seem to be in constant change and therefore there seems to be no status quo equilibriums. That is why systems in connection to power cannot remain the same although that seem to be the pattern in human systems so far.</p>
