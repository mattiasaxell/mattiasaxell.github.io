<h2 class="section-heading">What Have I Done Today?</h2>

<p>Half-finished my SWOT awaiting more input from peers based on the Hacked E-Myth entrepreneurial personalities.</p>

<p>Gotten in touch with organisers of a corporate event that might be of interest for my exam project. E-mailed an organiser of another large digital event to test my hypothesis and see if it is relevant to research.</p>

<p>Started created my an learning evaluation tool based on the idea of liminality. I want to shine light on who I was before Kaospilot, pre-liminality, what I was good at then, who I am now in the liminal transition and who I strive to be in the post-liminal stage.</p>

<p>Finished another Scope Wheel and did my first Scan Card! It goes fast when I just get to it!</p>

<p>Had to pleasure to finish off the day by sharing my learnings from doing process consulting with the next generation of students at Kaospilot.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- My irreverence towards myself and my workflow. I have a hard time following through with one task at a time.
- The revalation that the unplanned research process I am going through makes me progress slowly, one day at a time. This needs to be resolved soon!
- That I learn from experience of my assignment at Kaospilot to do process consulting - just by talking about the experiences and doings!

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

- My thought on that throughout this Creative Research Design my life and research will take me to new places every day.
- The attitude toward the engagement, reminding to base everything positive, fun, laughter and what gives me energy.
- That I need to be spot on with how much I take on for this third year project and *Why* I do it.
