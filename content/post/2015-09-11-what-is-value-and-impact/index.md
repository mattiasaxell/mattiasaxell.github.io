<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

<p>Had a good lecture by my team leader about Value & Impact which mentioned radical thinkers like Ivan Illich, Mannfred Max Neef and Donella Meadows.</p>

<p>Read in the Trust-book.</p>

<p>Engaged in a "hackathon" which I think is more of a design lab. I think I might be only one working on something completely digital. Will post the result here later.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Tools have I Used?</h2>

- Deep Listening

<blockquote>“School is the advertising agency which makes you believe that you need the society as it is.” ― Ivan Illich</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

<p>The great amount of interest to engage in the "hackathon" for refugees, which I am happy about.</p>

<blockquote>“Speak the truth. Speak it loud and often, calmly but insistently, and speak it, as the Quakers say, to power. Material accumulation is not the purpose of human existence. All growth is not good. The environment is a necessity, not a luxury. There is such a thing as enough.” - Donella Meadows</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

<p>The importance of seeing that my research finds leverage points and places to do intervention is valuable and that my exam project supports it.</p>

<p>My confidence as learning how to be a "hacker" although I am just learning how to transform a website creates a lot of joy!</p>
