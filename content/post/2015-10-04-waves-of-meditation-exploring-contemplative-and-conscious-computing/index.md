<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

- Watched the video of the Tesla Model X production launch.
- Talked with Andri Geirsson about exam project and initiative.
- Took a great initiative to disconnect from the Internet and get out to the beach where I could work on writing learning journey and e-mails to send off. Slowly but surely I am going in a direction toward more contemplative and conscious computing.
- Spent some time on writing e-mails but mainly got busy hanging out with people.

<blockquote>“I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.” - The Salmon of Doubt, Douglas Adams</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Tools have I Used?</h2>

- E-mails
- Deep listening - with the Theory U course listening to Ed Schein's background to becoming a systems thinker.
- Stakeholder Analysis

<h2 class="section-heading">How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today?</h2>

- I feel good but I am starting to look forward to go back to Stockholm for the fall vacation. I am tired of spending so much time at school where there is a secure and proper Internet connection. 

- The project feels great. There has been very rewarding calls this previous weeks and more upcoming!

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- How slow I can be when I do not have a visualized to-do list...

<blockquote>“Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.” - Albert Einstein</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

- The way I approach my days and to-dos. From now on I will be more pushy toward myself to have to-dos list from the day before. Which I always have because of this learning journal.

<h2 class="section-heading">What are the Next Action Steps?</h2>

- Making the backtracking
- Making a few calls
- Clarifying my schools of thought, approaches and tools
