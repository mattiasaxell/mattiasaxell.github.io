<h1 class="section-heading">Outcome</h1>

<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

- Almost finished preparations completely. Did not manage to download and screen a website locally with photos at the MoN.
- Managed to say goodbye for now to a few of Team 20. I realise that my disliking of putting myself in the center of attention hindered me to make a collective goodbye.

<h2 class="section-heading">How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today?</h2>

- I feel really good.

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- That when reflecting on not wanting to put myself in the centre to say goodbye to the entire Team 20 at the same time was a decision that in the end was based on fear.

<blockquote>"Do what you can do, as well as you can do it, every day of you life, and you will end up dying one of the happiest individuals that ever died." - Howard Lyman</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

- From now on I desire to hack my own system and doing not what I might not appreciate the most, which might be egoistic but do what I believe the whole would appreciate the most, in this case informing the entire Team 20 that I am leaving.
