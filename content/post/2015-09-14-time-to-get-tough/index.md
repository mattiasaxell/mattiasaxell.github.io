<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

<p>How little that I really dig into the hardships in my life to really figure things out.</p>

<p>That the time at Kaospilot community has made me flourish more outside the community than within.</p>

<p>There was not any moment during the day that I felt that I wanted to contribute.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

<p>That I definitely want to go more into the essentials of matters, the tough and the ugly, more than I have wanted before, not because of this session but because I accept that I wish to do that.</p>

<p>I am philosofing quite often on my own but it could be wise to write those thoughts down...</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What are the Next Action Steps?</h2>

- Getting fresh from illness.
- Implementing a better harvesting system for all my actions and learnings other than the learning journal.
- Scaling down the ambition of this learning journal more to the essentials.
