<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

- Got up super early to travel back to Kaospilot in Aarhus.
- Almost completely finished catching up with learning journals.
- Had a explorative and rewarding talk with Morten Stabell Hagelund of Team 21.
- Sent quite a lot of e-mails!

<h2 class="section-heading">What Tools have I Used?</h2>

- Reflective Journaling
- Dialogue

<h2 class="section-heading">How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today?</h2>

- I feel empty because of too few hours of sleep. I realise I cannot be working and functioning this year with too little sleep. It's setting myself up for failure but was a once off mistake.
- It feels great to have a day of mainly reflecting.

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- How long it takes to remember and recap the most important things from only some days back.

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

- I need to keep up with journalling if it shall have it's purpose. I'm also curious if the format from Theory U's reflective journalling can be of more value.

<h2 class="section-heading">What are the Next Action Steps?</h2>

- Get proper amount of sleep - for real!
- Making a preject for potential collaboration with my peer teammate - the one and only Alisa Hentze.
- Prepare an I DO ART for tomorrow's talk with Johan Nilsson at SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden.
