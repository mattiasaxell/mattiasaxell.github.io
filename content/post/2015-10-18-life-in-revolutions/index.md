<h2 class="section-heading">How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today?</h2>

- I feel great, taking it quite easy and not planning and doing anything special that I usually do. The project is in a good place, I feel that a lot of the times that I think about it.

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

- It surprised me that although I felt great I felt that I could not really relax. I feel that it can be because of what has happened and the Learning Design deadline I have on Wednesday at 12.00.

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

- My perception of how I can create conditions to not engage in my work and what I like. Re-start my routines for physical exercise and interest for playing music or drawing.
