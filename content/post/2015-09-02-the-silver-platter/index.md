<h2 class="section-heading">What Have I Done Today?</h2>

<p>Worked on the Scope Wheel during the morning. Along with the S.T.E.E.P.V. model mapping out the positive change I wish to bring to areas & systems in society.</p>

<p>I spoke and interviewed the organiser of the a national hackathon event in Sweden which felt very promising for a third year project.</p>

<p>Had a very inspiring session with Mat Lincez of Idea Couture, Toronto office. We talked about my exam project being somehow researching the possibility for a Zero Waste society with the perspective of informational management and utilization. Something we stated about data & information being underutilized in this discontinous world where it is maybe more needed than ever.</p>

<p>Ate dinner with a team mate discussing the Kaospilot project as a foundation for the future and not to put other dreams to rest.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Tools have I Used?</h2>

- Scope Wheel
- S.T.E.E.P.V.
- Interview Persona Card
- Expert Interview
- Coaching & sparring a team mate on Scope Wheel
- [Habitica](https://habitica.com) (formerly known as HabitRPG) - an Open Source Getting Things Done-manager with great features of Gamification.

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

<p>That I wasn't as challenged by Mat Lincez with my thoughts as I expected to be, or maybe hoped to be. I thought I would be more questioned to expand my horizon but maybe that was a sign that I have and am already trying to look for what is coming ahead in the future.</p>

<p>That there is such a potential in developing the work I am already doing, keeping it more simple. I can still keep it to being an explorative kind of exam project but using existing pieces of work that I already am engaged in. Setting myself up for success. Hopefully...!</p>

<blockquote>Keep it Simple Stupid</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

<p>I'm rethinking my attitude towards creating something entirely new out of nothing and instead moving with good assets, resources an networks that I already have an influence and interest in.</p>

<p>A lot has changed in the last two days. I really want to use what is coming for digging deeper into where I now stand with what I now know.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What are Additional Learnings?</h2>

<p>Do things in the prioritised order based on when it needs to be done.</p>

<p>Gamification and peer pressure of a service such as Habitica adds engagement in doing things right.</p>
