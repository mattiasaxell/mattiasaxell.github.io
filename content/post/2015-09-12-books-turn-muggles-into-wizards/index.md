<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

<p>Almost finished hacking together a forked website for open data which I'll mention in the future posts. It's a part of my HTML/CSS learning journey.</p>

<p>Read in the book "Trust".</p>

<p>Worked on more infrastructural stuff with my voluntary engagement.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Tools have I Used?</h2>

- HTML & CSS
- Scope Wheel
- Scan Card

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

<p>How easy it is to make things work with HTML & CSS, learning by doing is once again showing how great it is.</p>

<p>That basically everything in society and systems are based on trust. To me it seems that trust comes with honesty and authenticity, which also is a trend within branding.</p>

<p>My extreme quickness with scanning, very important and easy to get.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

<p>With my believed success of reshaping a website and lots of learning and confidence that came with that I am definitely thinking about what the power of programming can do for my third year.</p>

<p>That I now consider trust as an integral part of how I build a relationship in anything. Thinking of how I can create trust in my relationships requires some kinds of actions and the removal of others.</p>

<p>My attitude towards scanning. Choosing something to scan makes so much sense and then to iterate and get back to the Scope Wheel.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What are the Next Action Steps?</h2>

- Finishing Trust.
- Getting the website done as soon as possible would be great...
- Reading more and more!
- Taking some time for fulfilling my need of so-called "idleness"...
