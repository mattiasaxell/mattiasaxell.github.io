<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

<p>Finished the Application!</p>

<p>Had a talk about socializing</p>

<p>Started the Theory U course on an online platform run by its creator Otto Scharmer. Great introduction. Curious to explore how it can help me unfold my highest potential for the exam project.</p>

<p>Was finally able to continue reading in the book "Trust"! Will go full on with reading now!</p>

<blockquote>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. - Henry David Thoreau</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Tools have I Used?</h2>

- Gameplan
- Budgeting
- Pomodoro Technique

<blockquote>Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth's surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid. - Bertrand Russell, In Praise of Idleness and Other Essays (1935)</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

<p>That I got done with the funding application one hour before deadline, better timing than ever! I succeeded in proactivity!</p>

<p>My aversion to some kinds of social gatherings when I feel that a certain kind of unspoken peer pressure in the culture is heavily influcening the socialization.</p>

<p>That I need to reconsider how I can change myself in order to get around things that frustrates myself in certain situations.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

<p>My feelings toward what may happen in November if the project gets the funding. If it happens it happens. Whatever happens I will be looking forward.</p>

<p>The approach I have from now on when engaging in social gatherings that are less interesting for me. I wish to do more experimentation.</p>

<p>That I have gone from doing application to reading-mode.</p>
