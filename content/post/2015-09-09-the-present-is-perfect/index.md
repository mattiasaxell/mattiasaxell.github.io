<h2 class="section-heading">What have I Done Today?</h2>

<p>Basically spent the whole day writing on the application to make it as clear as possible.</p>

<p>Had a good talk with a friend about work, free time and engagement in different projects. Catching up. Very good talk!</p>

<p>Got up to date with the potential collaboration I might venture into to use 'Heuristic Inquiry' as part of my exam project. Exciting...!</p>

<p>In the evening I have gotten a lot of feedback on the application. That was great for confidence and adding that last piece of engagement to finish it.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Surprised Me?</h2>

<p>How much energy I have in something as boxed-in, bureaucratic and old-school as a project application filling out boxes of text. It is a fascinating feeling how much commitment can take me through things I otherwise would consider extremely boring.</p>

<p>The compliment feedback I got on my project funding application for being very bureaucratic in my language. Does that mean that I cannot be considered an entrepreneur & innovator?</p>

<p>That so many people in my generation seem to be unfolding a higher consciousness toward what they do and work with is not aligned with how they want to live. I can see a lot of change happening just because of this change of attitude toward work and lifestyle.</p>

<p>That I got another person to join the habit-hacking service Habitica. It really makes sense to me and it is a lot of fun gamifying the Getting-Things-Done methodology.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What has Changed?</h2>

<p>The thought that there maybe is a big possibility that I use my third year exam project on what I will apply for funding with.</p>

<p>Realising that I am very keen on going into the free online Theory U course and exploring Heuristic Inquiry.</p>

<p>The feeling that I tomorrow will be free from constant writing to get project funding! I can see the light in the end of the tunnel, very much looking forward.</p>
