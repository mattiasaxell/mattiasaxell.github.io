        Intention I DO ART Intention Do the Museum of Now (MoN) and get on my way back to Stockholm Desired Outcome Prepared last things for MoN. Take farewell of Team 20. Done MoN for as long as I could before having to leave. Get on the train back to Stockholm. Agenda Same as D.O. in that order. Rules and Roles Done is better than perfect. Storyteller Time 08.00-15.00 Outcome What have I Done Today? Almost finished preparations completely. Did not manage to download and screen a website locally with photos at the MoN. Managed to say goodbye for now to a few of Team 20. I realise that my disliking of putting myself in the center of attention hindered me to make a collective goodbye. &#34;There is no them, there is only us&#34; - Bill Clinton What Tools have I Used? Hashtags Narrative Storytelling Visualizations (Website &amp; Movie) &#34;You can change the world, you must change the world&#34; - Howard Lyman How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel really good. What Surprised Me? That when reflecting on not wanting to put myself in the centre to say goodbye to the entire Team 20 at the same time was a decision that in the end was based on fear. &#34;Do what you can do, as well as you can do it, every day of you life, and you will end up dying one of the happiest individuals that ever died.&#34; - Howard Lyman What has Changed? From now on I desire to hack my own system and doing not what I might not appreciate the most, which might be egoistic but do what I believe the whole would appreciate the most, in this case informing the entire Team 20 that I am leaving. What are the Next Action Steps? Photographs by The Commons.</a></p>

        What have I Done Today? Attended a lecture by Morten Nottelmann. It was about how to network and build great relationships that may sustain. Worked on sending e-mails. Started looking into what to do for Museum of Now. Enjoyed a “X-Team Dinner” with different people from Team 20, Team 21 and Team 22 at Kaospilot. It is quite a tradition in order to build a good spirit and get to know people among the teams. What Tools have I Used? Listening Graphical Recording How do I Feel?

        What have I Done Today? Got up super early to travel back to Kaospilot in Aarhus. Almost completely finished catching up with learning journals. Had a explorative and rewarding talk with Morten Stabell Hagelund of Team 21. Sent quite a lot of e-mails! What Tools have I Used? Reflective Journaling Dialogue How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel empty because of too few hours of sleep. I realise I cannot be working and functioning this year with too little sleep. It’s setting myself up for failure but was a once off mistake. It feels great to have a day of mainly reflecting. What Surprised Me? How long it takes to remember and recap the most important things from only some days back. What has Changed? I need to keep up with journalling if it shall have it’s purpose. I’m also curious if the format from Theory U’s reflective journalling can be of more value. What are the Next Action Steps? Get proper amount of sleep - for real! Making a preject for potential collaboration with my peer teammate - the one and only Alisa Hentze. Prepare an I DO ART for tomorrow’s talk with Johan Nilsson at SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden. Photographs by The Commons.</a></p>

        What have I Done Today? Worked on the third iteration of my Learning Design. Talked to Eva-Karin Anderman at SVID about a potential collaboration at Service Convention Sweden in December 2015. Called Anette Novak at The Interactive Institute because she is doing a Government Official Report about the future of the government subsidies for news outlets. Called Jocke Jardenberg who is the “Head of Internet&#34;in Helsingborg city. I am trying to get to talk about a possible collaboration on Open Data with Helsingborg Kommun. Sent a bunch of e-mails, to e.g. Johan and Niklas whom both work at the State Technical Research Institute. &#34;Be genuinely interested in everyone you meet and everyone you meet will be genuinely interested in you&#34; - Rasheed Ogunlaru What Tools have I Used? Writing Phone Appreciative Inquiry E-mails How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel quite disconnected today. Empty in a way. It is not because of my project but because of everything that has happened during this vacation. I feel that this choice to skip school today was a very conscious one. As I can remember this was the first time in a long while that I skipped a day of school in order to do something else. In this case it was in order to say yes to something bigger happening tomorrow. What Surprised Me? That it was so many of my peers who skipped class as well, and seemingly no one informed our guest lecturer of their absence Bliss Brown which was a bit awkward. &#34;Some books are just better left unread&#34; - &#34;Stiches&#34; by Polinski What has Changed? My sense of trusting my gut feeling about what choices I make. I feel good I stayed in Stockholm to participate at what I am saying yes to instead of guest lectures. What are the Next Action Steps? Finish my slide for the presentation at the SOU Hack event tomorrow at the National Library of Sweden. Get ready to facilitate and observe the open space technology process at the SOU Hack. (“SOU” is an abbreviation for Statliga Offentliga Utredningar, which in English means Governmental Official Reports). Finish the third iteration of my learning design Pack and get ready to get back to Kaospilot in Aarhus, Denmark. Photographs by The Commons.</a></p>

        What have I Done Today? Celebrated another revolution in my life. Got to see one of my relatives and have a splendid dinner together. &#34;The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.&#34; - Hans Hofmann What Tools have I Used? Mise En Place Situational Methodology Writing Storytelling How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel great, taking it quite easy and not planning and doing anything special that I usually do. The project is in a good place, I feel that a lot of the times that I think about it. What Surprised Me? It surprised me that although I felt great I felt that I could not really relax. I feel that it can be because of what has happened and the Learning Design deadline I have on Wednesday at 12.00. What has Changed? My perception of how I can create conditions to not engage in my work and what I like. Re-start my routines for physical exercise and interest for playing music or drawing. What are the Next Action Steps? Work on Learning Design Prepare for the hack event at the National Library of Sweden on Tuesday. Take a decision regarding technical support for one of my projects.

        What have I Done Today? Nothing… As far as I can remember. What Tools have I Used? None. How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel OK. This week has been one of the most challenging ones personally. Project-wise it has however been very rewarding professionally. What Surprised Me? How much up and down life is going right now. It is a confusing and interesting time. What has Changed? Maybe that reminder about my life in that perspective. That I can feel down in one aspect but very much up in another. What are the Next Action Steps? Get some more time to relax. Start preparing my Learning Design. Getting proper sleep! Photographs by The Commons.</a></p>

        What have I Done Today? Met with Kaospilot alumni Anna Edwall who works as a programme manager at VINNOVA, the Swedish Innovation Agency. Cancelled a lunch with one of my mentors. Instead I managed to have an online call with my peer Sir Robin Lewis Christensen of Copenhagen. Had a meeting with Robert Szabó, CEO of an accounting &amp; outsourcing company. What Tools have I Used? Humble Inquiry Process Mapping Mindmap How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel great and the project feels awesome today because of the great meetings and conversations I have been going through. What Surprised Me? I got so enlightened from talking to Anna Edwall who reminded me about the importance on creating an initiative that is diverse out of the core. Not only in skills but also from gender and background. Meeting with Robert Szabó was also rewarding in the sense of getting questioned about - “where are the revenue streams?” What has Changed? I will make more research into how I can involve diversity but I will also really consider how I build a sustainable business model design for this. What are the Next Action Steps? Taking as much of the weekend off as possible. Get into a habit of setting a weekly intention. Start looking into the learning design again. Photographs by The Commons.</a></p>
