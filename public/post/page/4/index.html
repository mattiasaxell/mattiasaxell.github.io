        What have I Done Today? Sent tonnes of e-mail Had dinner with Hilmar in my team, a great relaxing evening! Spoke with Pär about potential project collaboration. Finished a very early draft What Tools have I Used? E-mail Stakeholder Interview Appreciative Inquiry Generative Listening How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel great and happy, so glad to finally to hang out with Hilmar. After a lot of talking he took the initiative to let me to the walking.</a></p>

        What have I Done Today? Watched the video of the Tesla Model X production launch. Talked with Andri Geirsson about exam project and initiative. Took a great initiative to disconnect from the Internet and get out to the beach where I could work on writing learning journey and e-mails to send off. Slowly but surely I am going in a direction toward more contemplative and conscious computing. Spent some time on writing e-mails but mainly got busy hanging out with people. “I&#39;ve come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies: 1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. 2. Anything that&#39;s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. 3. Anything invented after you&#39;re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.” - The Salmon of Doubt, Douglas Adams What Tools have I Used? E-mails Deep listening - with the Theory U course listening to Ed Schein’s background to becoming a systems thinker. Stakeholder Analysis How do I Feel? How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel good but I am starting to look forward to go back to Stockholm for the fall vacation. I am tired of spending so much time at school where there is a secure and proper Internet connection.</a></p>

        What have I Done Today? Finished week 2 of Theory U. Almost finished Week 3 of Theory U. Went to my team mate Kristoffer’s boat and had a great talk and dinner. Boat-life is the great life. Watched the last part of All Watched Over by The Loving Machines of Grace called “The Monkey in the Machine or the Machine in the Monkey” &#34;There&#39;s a big, thick book called The Authoritarian Personality that came out of many years of research. But, as a sideline, we also were very concerned about what was going on in the US. We had our own version of horrific behavior in discovering what was going on in the South with the slaves. Theoretically, no more slavery but practically, segregation was very operational...&#34; What Tools have I Used? Deep Listening E-mail Sensing &#34;... And some of what led eventually to the marches and some of the serious conflicts that happened in the US, that was another force that was bringing social scientists, particularly Kurt Lewin, or Levine, the German social psychologist. I was very enamored of his experiments where he showed that an authoritarian classroom could be just as productive as a democratic classroom...&#34; How do I Feel today? How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel quite alright after all the love that was shared yesterday. I was a little surprised that some expected the event to only romanticize love, that is rarely the only aspect of love!</a></p>

        What have I Done Today? Attended the second day of lecture and workshop with Zaid Hassan. Started using the frameworks for how to turn my exam project into multiple projects. Went to the Love Symposium that was hosted for the third year at the Kaospilot education. It was an enjoyable evening experience all the love that was expressed among participants through speeches and performances! Photo</a></p>

        What have I Done Today? Attended the first day of lecturing and workshop with Zaid Hassan, author of the book “The Social Labs Revolution”. Had a great conversation with Marcus Nygren, founder of CoderDojo in Norrköping, Sweden. Missed a call with a group of people because of my lack of attention to time. What Tools have I Used? The Social Labs Triangle Frameworks for Complex Challenges Humble Inquiry How do I Feel generally and about the Project Today? I feel extremely happy to have Zaid Hassan as a guest educator at the school talking about social labs. This has really gotten me even more inspired for the project bringing in a lot of new perspectives. What Surprised Me? That someone else than me (in this case Marcus Nygren) clarified the frames for a talk. Very sharp and experienced! What has Changed? The reminder to get back to using I DO ART to clarify frames for the important conversations that takes place between me and others during my research and work with this project. Clear frames are important for a successful collaboration. What are the Next Action Steps? Attend tomorow’s lecture and enjoy all the fruits of tools and understanding for working with social labs as a framework. Go to the Love Symposium. Answer all the e-mails that I have gotten as replies to from last weekend’s rampage sending lots of e-mails! Photographs by The Commons.</a></p>

        What have I Done Today? Enjoyed last day with Carol Sandford. Migrated from one laptop breaking down to another one breaking down. Awesome right? The Opposite of Sexy is Rationality What Tools have I Used? Levels of Change Essence of Personalities Exercise How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel like time is being consumed by unimportant things. I want to be scanning more and sensing in order to follow my Theory U framework. What Surprised Me? What did surprise to an extent but not surprised me at all was when Carol Sandford spoke about her Native American ancestry. It was fascinating to hear the horrible story about the “Trail of Tears”. It was a forced removal of native americans who had to march from their homelands across several states to so-called “Indian reservations”. 90% of all Native Americans who marched died. What has Changed? My thinking and concerns My ability to discern different The intention that I will now be much more discerning when listening, trying to figure out what paradigms the transmitter is communicating from. The way I think around what I can control and not control, what I consider for myself, external considerations and how that changes my personal agency. What are the Next Action Steps? Planning Archiving Reflecting Executing To-Dos. Photographs by The Commons.</a></p>

        What have I Done Today? Participated in Carol Sandfords workshop and lecture on being Discerning. Watched a bit of a movie for the first time in a long while. Happiness can be defined, in part at least, as the fruit of the desire and ability to sacrifice what we want now for what we want eventually. - Steven R. Covey What Tools have I Used? Listening Theory U Discernment &#34;We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.&#34; - T. S. Eliot How do I Feel about the Project Today? The project feels rejuvenated once again by a fantastic day of multiple inputs. I also lost a bit of engagement in doing anything else than just relaxing. So that’s what I did because that was what my mind needed. What Surprised Me? That there is hope a regenerative future, starting with frameworks that create a regenerative life! What has Changed? New aspects to integrate into my project which are absolutely invaluable! What are the Next Action Steps? Fixing my situation with the computers, it is becoming uncomfortable to see that my engagement is slowed because of that. I really don’t like buying new electronics because there are often such wasteful processes of resources use. Photographs by The Commons.</a></p>

        What have I Done Today? Woke up in the shelter of the forrest that I went to sleep in. Great experience. Listened Called a potential project stakeholder. Watched “The House that I Live in.” Charles Darwin was known to always have a note pad on him, where he would write down observations that contradicted his theory, because he knew exactly what our mind is doing. When we notice something that doesn&#39;t fit our theory, it&#39;s in contradiction with that. Our mind is over time getting rid of everything that&#39;s not confirming what we expect to see. But he knew that disconfirming data is actually the source of innovation. - Otto E. Scharmer What Tools have I Used? Discernment Generative listening Reflection Become learning people, rather than teachers. It&#39;s all about learning. - Ed Schein How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel extremely good about it. There is a lot happening and a lot to do. I still feel like I need to start reading everything that I wish to read. And there is so much archiving and data journaling to be done. What Surprised Me? How I could see a shooting star for the second time in a short while. Beautiful! That most of our methods and system designs in society are not more evolved than being based on mechanistic or behavioural paradigms. “I don&#39;t define things, I create a territory in which we explore” - Carol Sandford What has Changed? My level of discernment with the choice of tools and consciousness in choosing tools and methodologies. The view on destruction after watching the fantastic movie “The House that I Live in”. The Chain of Destruction is explained to generally happen in this process: Identification Austricism Confiscation Concentration Annihilation What are the Next Action Steps? Read the scientific paper “Forth and Fifth Levels of Systems Thinking” provided by Carol Sandford. Finish Really take the time to go through the to-dos, now I managed to list some at least. “If you want to take a problem to make it a huge problem then ask the wrong questions and then feed us with the wrong answer. &#34; - Charles Bowden Photographs by The Commons.</a></p>

        What have I Done Today? Watched beginning of “The House that I Live in”. Had two great calls regarding the project. Finished first week of Theory U. Gone out to sleep in the forrest. &#34;The success of an intervention depends on the interior condition of the intervenor.&#34; - Bill O&#39;Brien, CEO of Hanover Insurance What Tools have I Used? Reflective Journaling. &#34;Real learning is a process that involves three core activities: 1. Observe, observe, observe; 2. Retreat and reflect to allow inner knowing to emerge; 3. Act in an instant.&#34; - Brian Arthur https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/W._Brian_Arthur How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel so great, after having to great calls. What Surprised Me? How rewarding the calls were and how much things can change by talking. 1. Energy follows attention 2. We have to go through a process that deals with three main movements, or &#34;inner gestures&#34;: 1. Observe, observe, observe; 2. Retreat and reflection, allow the inner knowing to emerge; 3. Act in an instant 3. This three-stage process only works if we cultivate the inner instruments: Open Mind, Open Heart, Open Will 4. At the source of this inner cultivation process are the two root questions of creativity: Who is my Self? What is my Work? 5. This process is the road less traveled because the moment you begin, you are going to face three enemies that prevent you from accessing your deeper sources of creativity: Voice of Judgment, Voice of Cynicism, Voice of Fear. 6. This opening process is not only important to do as an individual; you need to hold the space to go through the same process on a collective level. - Otto E. Scharmer What has Changed? My plans for the research period. Feels like I have found a base to work with. What are the Next Action Steps? Calling a potential stakeholder. Getting ready for lecture with Carol Sandford!

        What have I Done Today? Written tonnes of e-mails to send out. In 2010, worldwide, more people killed themself in suicide than were being killed through war, murder, and natural disasters combined. - Otto E. Scharmer What Tools have I Used? Storytelling And if we look back to the 20th century, here&#39;s how we have responded. In government, we create one or several ministry for each of these problem clusters. And international organizations, we create 1, or several, UN organizations for each of these clusters. In NGOs, we create special, single-focus NGOs on environmental issues, on social issues, and on cultural issues. And, of course, in academia, we have, for each of these issues, one or several departments. That&#39;s how we have been responding, basically, silo-type of approaches that address the problem at the symptom level, not at the root level, and that largely miss the interdependency across these problems. - Otto E. Scharmer How do I Feel about the Project Today? I feel alright, I want to get more digital and visual with the planning of it. What Surprised Me? How long time it takes to write long e-mails. What has Changed? My view on the time I spend on e-mails. I want to write shorter and faster, spend less time on that. What are the Next Action Steps? Getting done with 1st week of Theory U! How does it really work that some profound new innovation is really coming into the world? How does the new come into the world? And what we realized is that the accounts that we heard, the first person stories from the innovators, were somehow quite different to the story that you learn in school; the normal organizational learning story. And one of them- Brian Arthur, formerly Stanford University and now Santa Fe institute- he put a particular simple and accessible language around this other process. And when we asked him how it works he said, first off, you need to realize that there are two different sources of cognition. One is what he called downloading. And downloading is basically using existing frameworks and lowering them to a situation. And the other one is what he referred to as knowing, a deeper learning cycle that according to Brian Arthur is at the core of each profound innovation in science, business, and in society. So we asked him, what really does it take to move beyond the downloading and activate this other deeper process of knowing? And he basically laid out a core process of three main activities, which are observe, observe, observe. So what does it mean: Observe, observe, observe? It means stop downloading. Discontinue the old habitual ways of operating, the old habits of judgment, and totally immerse yourself into the reality you&#39;re dealing with. Totally immerse yourself into the places of most potential, the context that can teach you most about how to deal and respond to the situation and the challenge that you&#39;re dealing with. Number two, retreat and reflect, allow the inner knowing to emerge. So observe, observe is you go out into the world. You talk to the operators, you&#39;re out there on the streets. This one is something different. This is everyone comes back together and is sharing what they learned, sharing the golden keys of insight that they gathered across places. And then, as everyone is listening to what has been learned, you do it with a mindset that&#39;s not only asking what is it that&#39;s really wanting to emerge in the world there, but also what is the story of the future that I want to be part of, that we want to be part of? So retreat and reflect, allow the inner knowing to emerge, is really about accessing our deeper sources of knowing, our deeper sources of intuition. He also said, go to the place of stillness where knowing comes to surface. So this is about connecting to our deeper sources of intuition. And then, when maybe kind of a spark or two, an idea of a possible future shows up from that, number three, explore them by doing. Act in an instant means you explore these ideas through rapid cycle prototyping to do something very local, very quick, in a way that generates feedback from others, that helps you to iterate, refine, and evolve your idea. So that&#39;s really the first insight that I had. - Otto E. Scharmer Photographs by The Commons.</a></p>
