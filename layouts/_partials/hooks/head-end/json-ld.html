  "description": "Helping you access, organize and secure everything important to you with EntryScape @MetaSolutions / Handlingar.se @Open Knowledge Sweden. I have been developing products, services and organizations since my first work experience in 2007 throughout a multiplicity of different roles. As a contributor to processes, organizations and initiatives I contribute with a developmental mindset and point of entry. I strive to embed Regenerative Thinking in all my work and engagement. My passion is to work with redesigning and impacting different sorts of systems to make regenerative development possible. I wish to contribute to solutions which combine the development of technical, human, social and thinking capacity. I believe that the only limit to solving problems and challenges are our thinking and ways of approaching them. My aims are to create healthier, holistic, regenerative systems in order to grow and expand life and consciousness.",
