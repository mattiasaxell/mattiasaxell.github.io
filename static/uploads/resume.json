    "summary": "I have been developing products, services and organizations since my first work experience in 2007 through a multiplicity of different roles. As a contributor to processes, organizations and initiatives I bring a developmental mindset and fresh perspective. I strive to embed Regenerative Thinking in all my work and engagement. My passion is to redesign and impact different kinds of systems to make regenerative development possible. I wish to contribute to solutions which combine the development of technical, human, social and thinking capacity. I believe that the only limit to solving problems and challenges is our thinking and ways of approaching them. My aim is to create healthier, holistic, regenerative systems in order to grow and expand life and consciousness.",
